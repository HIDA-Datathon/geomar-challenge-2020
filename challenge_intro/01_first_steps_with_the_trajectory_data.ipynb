    "- `\"traj\"`: Trajectory ID\n",

    "\n",
    "Data variables:\n",
    "- `\"time\"`: Time stamps for each position.\n",
    "- `\"z\"`: Vertical component (counted below the sea surface) for each position\n",
    "- `\"lat\"`: [Latitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system#Latitude_and_longitude) for each position\n",
    "- `\"lon\"`: [Longitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system#Latitude_and_longitude) for each position\n",
    "- `\"distance\"`: along-trajectory distance traveled since trajectory started\n",
    "- `\"temp\"`: Temerature felt at each position\n",
    "- `\"land\"`: Influcence of land-points felt at each position. See below for details.\n",
    "- `\"MPA\"`: Marine Protected Area this trajectory started in\n",
    "\n",
    "Why sample `\"land\"` influence? — Due to post-processing of the simulated Ocean current fields (originally meant to make it more convenient to work with the data...), the velocity data used to drive these virtual fish larvae are not accurately respecting the (horizontal) continuity equation. In the open Ocean this is not much of a problem as the error introduced is of the same order as the discretization error (~grid resolution of the velocity data). Close to the coast, however, the error can lead to spurious beaching or unrealistically slow ocean currents very close to the coast. To be able to handle larvae that come too close to the coast in post processing, we've detected the fraction of land data that influenced the larva at each position.\n",
    "\n",
    "What about the `\"MPA\"`'s? — There are many [mostly near-shore protected areas in the Mediterranean Sea](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bw8D-TFFFccxNUwyVXBONHdjUVk/view) that are meant to ensure stable population of marine animals. The data we use here stems from a study that investigated the genetic connectivity of these MPSs with each other and with other non-protected parts of the Mediterranean Sea by letting virtual fish larvae spawn in different MPAs and then travel passively with the Ocean currents.\n",
    "\n",
    "What can we learn from `\"temp\"`? — The simulated larvae have a comfort temperature which allows them to live and thrive as they drift with the currents. If the temperature is too high or too low, this can have negative effects on the larvae."
